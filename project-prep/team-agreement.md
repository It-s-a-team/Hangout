# Team Agreement

## Cooperation Plan

*Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.*

***Describe at least:***

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
  - Rhea Carillo: My key strengths are with debugging, analyzing systems, and commenting code.
  - Alfredo Orquiz: My strengths are creativity, CSS, flexibility, and perseverance.
  - Jeffrey Smith: My strength is knowledge, organization, creative the flow of things.
  - David Suy: Strength is nodejs, aws, sql, nosql, react
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
  - Rhea Carillo: I can best utilize my strengths by analyzing others' code and looking for potential pitfalls, as well as figuring out the logic. I can also best utilize my skills by undergoing individual research and implementing new features.
  - Alfredo Orquiz: Whenever it comes to front-end, I can make a website look appealing to the customers eyes. I can also stay as late as possible in order to finish the job.
  - Jeffrey Smith: I do not not know how to utilize my strengths. I just go with the flow of things and jump in where need be.
- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Alfredo Orquiz: I would like to grow in the JavaScript technical proficiency. Better understand What the code that I am writing does, as well have a greater knowledge of the tools, as well s their implementation. I would also like to get better with the writers block. Whenever I have to start coding with JavaScript, I always freeze and don't know how to start.
  - Jeffrey Smith: I want to get over the fear of making mistakes in coding and physical do the stuff that create my fear.
  - Rhea Carillo: I would like to develop greater strengths in speaking.
  - 
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
  - The team has agreed to work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. We can be reached out throughout Slack, but there is no guaranteed answer that is required by each team member.
***NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.***

## Conflict Plan

*Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.*

***Describe at least:***

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  - We will discuss our conflict as a team and try to resolve it.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
  - We will talk to that individual as a team. If that that don't work, we will take up to the instructor.
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - We will come together and help each other if there seems to be a problem, try to explain it in a way that the team member can learn from it, and ensure that the team member can continue along with us.
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - We will speak with the member who doesn't seem to be contributing, converse to understand their situation and perspective and attempt to come to a solution on our own in the same day. If our team still isn't making progress, we'll escalate with the lead instructor, Jacob Knaack.
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  - If the conflict is not resolved in a timely matter, we will take it up with our instructor.
  
## Communication Plan

*Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.*

We will have a open communication policy open. Anyone is free to express themselves and share there ideas and opinions. No one will be shamed, and everyone is encouraged to speak up. Everyone has agree to be available during agreed schedule and open to any conversation about the project.

***Describe at least:***

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  - 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Weekdays is the agreed schedule.
- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  - The team has agreed to use Slack as out main form of communication. However if needed, the team member can provide their personal phone number if they can be reached after hours of operation.
- How often will you take breaks?
  - The team has agreed that there will be a break guideline with a 50 min timer. Once that timer ends, there will be a 10 min break. However, the members of the team is not required to follow this guidelines. One can take breaks on their own accord.
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Rhea Carillo: If I start to fall behind, I'll come to my team and ask for feedback and to code review. There's always a lot I can learn from others. If I need more structured advice, I'll ask the TAs, as well as our lead instructor.
- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  - We will continue to communicate through slack, or phone number if needed to communicate after hours.
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  - Giving everyone a chance to talk, and not speaking over each other.
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  - No judgement among each other. Let people talk and not judging them in the spot. We will not dismiss ideas without understanding each other's perspectives.

## Work Plan

*Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

***NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.***

***Describe at least:***

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  - The team will use a Trello Board that will keep track of our to do list. Each team member will tackle a task to which they are comfortable with. On the trello board we will have 3 sections; a "To-Do list" section, an "In Progress" section, and a "Completed" section. While someone is working on a task, we will move that into the "In Progress" section. Once completed, it will be put into the "Completed" section.
- What project management tool will be used?
  - We will use Trello to track and manage tasks.

## Presentation Deck

***Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.***

## Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

***Describe at least:***

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  - GitHub will house our source-code, as well as our project preparation documents.
- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  - We have a GitHub Organization where we all have admin access to all repositories.
- What is your Git flow?
  - We will utilize a `main` branch for production, as well as a `preProduction` branch for testing our live deployment. We will develop on individual `feature branches` pulled from the `preProduction` branch to working on feature tasks.
- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  - How many people must review a PR?
    - 3
  - Who merges PRs?
    - Anyone
  - How often will you merge?
    - We wil merge once daily, with working code that we've all agreed on the quality of to the pre-production branch, as well as the main branch.
